# UFoodMarketing


## Overview

The premise of this case study was to provide valuable insights to UFood, a food delivery app in Brazil. The main goal was to improve the performance of marketing activities, with a special focus on marketing campaigns. 

### Task

I was tasked to: 

1. Explore the data - provide insights, define cause and effect. Provide better understanding of characteristics.
2. Propose and describe customer segmentation based on customer behaviors
3. Visualize and provide written reason behind discoveries

### Findings

1. Ages 30-70 were spending more money but less likely to accept campaigns.
2. The catalog purhcases were more likely to accept campaigns, but customers spend more in person. Recommend a split between all forms. The web purchases is good, but customers using the catalog were accepting more campaigns. Higher margin for catalog: **40% catalog, 30% store, and 30% web**. Catalog may be willing to spend more money after the implementation of split.
3. Focus on people with less or no kids. They accept campaigns and spend more money on average.
4. Education has no impact, no need to target any specific group
5. Marital Status also does not play a big part. Married Single and Together groups spend more money.

### Marketing Insights

For profit leveraging:
+ Target high earning, middle aged people without children.

For attracting new customers:
+ Focus more on age groups 21-30 and 70+, since these groups statistically accepted campaigns at a higher rate.
